Naive Bayes Classifier
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier, a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. The implementation is written in Python and supports common Naive Bayes variants, including Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes. This project is designed for educational purposes and practical applications in text classification, spam detection, and more.
Features

Implementation of Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms.
Support for text classification tasks (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
Modular and extensible codebase.
Example datasets and usage scripts.
Easy-to-use API for custom datasets.

Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt):
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn (for comparison and dataset loading)



Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/naive-bayes.git
cd naive-bayes


Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Prepare your dataset: Place your dataset in the data/ folder or use the provided sample datasets (e.g., data/spam.csv for spam detection).
Run the example script:python examples/spam_classification.py

This script demonstrates how to use the Naive Bayes classifier for spam email detection.
Train your own model:
Modify src/main.py to load your dataset and configure the classifier.
Example code snippet:from naive_bayes import GaussianNaiveBayes
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')
X = data.drop('label', axis=1)
y = data['label']

# Initialize and train model
model = GaussianNaiveBayes()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X)
